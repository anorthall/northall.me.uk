<p class="lead">Below are a selection of photos that I have taken in Langcliffe Pot. There seems to be a bit of a shortage of images of this cave (on the
  internet, at least) and hopefully these pictures can be of some resource to those who would like to visit &mdash; or those who are simply curious.
  Clicking on a photo will open a larger, higher quality version in a new tab.
