On Christmas Day, 2021, I undertook a solo through trip of the Ease Gill cave system, from County Pot at the upstream end to Lancaster Hole at the downstream end. I'd previously explored the Ease Gill over a couple of trips &mdash; one into Lancaster Hole, and one from Lancaster Hole to Stop Pot and back &mdash; however this would be my first time going into County Pot and navigating the Manchester Bypass route back to the high level passages that form the "trade route" down towards Lancaster.

I filmed the entire trip using my helmet mounted GoPro, and the footage is available [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT5qONvpBYA). The footage is quite good in places, especially the first half of the trip where the passages are smaller. Unfortunately, when I arrived into the gigantic dimensions of Monster Cavern where the passages enlarge significantly and remain so for the duration of the trip, the video quality degrades considerably. 

I wouldn't recommend that anyone watches the full three hours of footage, but all of the locations along the route are listed in YouTube chapters so you can easily skip between different points on the trip. The fine streamway between the County Pot entrance to Battle of Britain Chamber was a highlight of the trip, as well as the section starting at Spangle Passage and ending at Main Line Terminus &mdash; an excellent bit of caving with lots of narrow squeezes and crawling, and even includes me going mad and talking to myself for a short period.

I was lighting the footage using only my 1600 lumen headtorch ([Fenix HM70R](https://starlessriver.com/shop/fenix-hm70r/) - highly recommended), and whilst it provided enough light for *me* to see, the camera could not quite keep up and you often could only see the floor immediately in front of me. While not ideal, I do think it gives a nice sense of the scale of the chambers to be able to see darkness around me. I'm waiting for the arrival of a [Fenix LR40R search torch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07V3ZJXHB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with a 12,000 lumen output &mdash; more than most car headlights &mdash; which I am hoping will improve the situation somewhat in large passages. The LR40R has received some very good reviews by other cavers, particularly [Keith Edwards on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH_zf_2xxd8).
