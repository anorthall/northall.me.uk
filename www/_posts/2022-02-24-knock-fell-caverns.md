[Knock Fell Caverns](https://cncc.org.uk/cave/knock-fell-caverns) is a unique trip for the caver who fancies something a bit different than the typical Yorkshire Dales stream cave. Located under the summit of Knock Fell, which is conveniently accessed from the A66 at Appleby-in-Westmorland, the cave presents a hugely varied series of interconnected passages running in a broadly north-south and east-west direction. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorhouse_and_Cross_Fell) states that the cave is the "most extensive maze cave system in Britain" and the navigational challenges within are not to be underestimated.

The publicly available [survey](/images/posts/knock_fell/knock_fell_survey.jpg) (also available [without annotations](/images/posts/knock_fell/knock_fell_unannotated.png)) highlights the complexity of the cave. What the survey does not show, however, is the huge variety of passage located within the system. This is a cave that has almost everything; most trips into the cave will encompass tight squeezes, as well as generously sized chambers, beautiful formations, unpleasant muddy crawls, impressively tall rifts, leisurely walking passage, boulder chokes, and (of course)  testing navigation.

Gracie and I, when visiting on 19th February 2022, got the impression that the cave does not receive a lot of traffic. Perhaps this is due to the location outside of the main Yorkshire Dales caving area, or the intimidating complexity - either way, it seems a shame! Many of the passages within looked as if they had barely visited (even on the main 'trade route' marked on the annotated survey) and the impressive orange-tinted formations were very well perserved.

Access to the cave is by way of a private road which was built to facilitate the construction of the [radar station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dun_Fell) which sits atop Great Dun Fell. The road is not on many navigation devices, although it is exceptionally well surfaced. Parking at a [lay-by near the top](https://goo.gl/maps/YMKWS9w48cnEWPPs7) gives immediate access to the Pennine Way which can be followed for around 600 meters to get to the cave in ten minutes or less. The lay-by provides space for just one vehicle (or maybe not even that, if you have a big car), but there are several of them along the distance of the road and space for a couple or three cars together right at the top near the radar station gate.

The views from this area (above) are spectacular and it is well worth a visit even if you are not intending to go underground. A northbound walk along the Pennine Way leads across to Cross Fell  which is the highest point in England outside of the Lake District at 893 meters. The single-track road is very steep (and therefore popular with masochistic cyclists) and great care would need to be taken in wintry conditions.

The entrance to the cave is a gated vertical shaft located in a group of deep shakeholes. GPS is strongly recommended to help locate the entrance! The 'lid' required quite a lot of persuasion to open and initially we were concerned we might be unable to do so - thankfully brute force and ignorance eventually prevailed. You may notice the padlock on the gate in the photo below - this was not locked round anything and no key was required. No permit is required to descend the system, as it is on access land, however the [CNCC website](https://cncc.org.uk/cave/knock-fell-caverns) states that Natural England request cavers seek authority to attend via email. In our case, the trip was planned at the last minute and we did not have time to do so.

No SRT is required to enter the cave and the [entrance climb down](/images/posts/knock_fell/knock_fell_entrance_climb.jpg) (8 meters) is quite straightforward even for the vertically challenged. We rigged a handline however this was not used for anything other than hauling the bag in and out.

A compass is absolutely essential on this trip and is required as soon as you reach the bottom of the entrance shaft. Two ways on are presented, with one being a tight connection towards the north end of the system and the more popular southern route leading to a relatively unpleasant, but short, rocky crawl towards the impressive Scotch Corner Chamber. Scotch Corner marks the beginning of a round trip which is suggested as a 'typical route' on the [survey](/images/posts/knock_fell/knock_fell_survey.jpg), which we followed in an anticlockwise direction.

We found the survey to be extremely accurate in the sections of cave that we visited, and our laminated copy was absolutely essential to the trip. We checked our bearing on the compass regularly and matched this with information on the survey and felt relatively sure of our location at all times (with one exception - later). I cannot empathise enough how easy it would be to get dangerously lost within this system. A lot of the passages can look very similar and a constant awareness of your position, and number of junctions you have passed in the current passage, is required. When we visit again we will take a permanent marker to mark off our progress on the survey as we travel, as it was quite some effort to try and concentrate on maintaining our location in our heads when chatting or looking at geological features.

I have seen tales online of an old tape marker system which once existed within this cave. We did see some remnants of this - the odd bit of tape was laid on a rock at a junction, or perhaps one was seen to have fallen between some rocks on the floor, but it did not produce any coherent navigation system that we could see, and should not be relied upon. Some arrows had also been drawn on walls in certain locations, but it was not always clear what they were pointing to (one would assume out, but it didn't always make sense that this would be the case).

No route description exists that I am aware of. If it did, it would be extremely hard to follow (*turn right, then pass three lefts, then turn left, then take the second right...*), and likely not in the 'spirit' of this sort of cave. Survey and compass was quite sufficient for us, as people who had never visited the cave before, and it is how I would recommend others approach this system if no tour guide is available.
